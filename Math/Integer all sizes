Question:
Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. 
There is no limit in size as there is: 2^31-1 (c++ int) or 2^63-1 (C++ long long int).

As we know, the result of  grows really fast with increasing .

Let's do some calculations on very large integers.

Task
Read four numbers a, b, c, and d and print the result of .

Input Format
Integers a, b, c, and d   are given on four separate lines, respectively.

Constraints
They all are natural numbers less than 1000



Output Format
Print the result of  on one line.
a^b+c^d

Output Format
Print the result of  on one line.

Solution:
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
d=int(input())
print(pow(a,b)+pow(c,d))
