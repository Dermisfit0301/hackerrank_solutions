Question:
You are given two sets ,A  and B.
Your job is to find whether set A is a subset of set B .

If set  A is subset of set B, print True.
If set  A is not a subset of set  B, print False.

Input Format

The first line will contain the number of test cases,T .
The first line of each test case contains the number of elements in set A.
The second line of each test case contains the space separated elements of setA .
The third line of each test case contains the number of elements in set B .
The fourth line of each test case contains the space separated elements of set B .

Constraints
 T less than 21
elements less than 1001
Output Format

Output True or False for each test case on separate lines.

Solution:
num=int(input())

for i in range(num):
    a=int(input())
    s1=set(map(int,input().split()))
    b=int(input())
    s2=set(map(int,input().split()))
    
    if s1.issubset(s2):
        print(True)
    else:
        print(False)
