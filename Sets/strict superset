Question:
You are given a set A and n other sets.
Your job is to find whether set  A is a strict superset of each of the n  sets.

Print True, if A is a strict superset of each of the n sets. Otherwise, print False.

A strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.


Input Format

The first line contains the space separated elements of set .
The second line contains integer , the number of other sets.
The next  lines contains the space separated elements of the other sets.

Constraints

Output Format

Print True if set A  is a strict superset of all other n sets. Otherwise, print False.

Sample Input 0

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 23 45 84 78
2
1 2 3 4 5
100 11 12
Sample Output 0

False


Solution:

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
A=set(map(int,input().split()))
n=int(input())

count=0
value=0
for i in range(n):
    B=set(map(int,input().split()))
    if A.issuperset(B):
        count+=1
    else:
        value+=1
if value!=0:
    print(False)
else:
    print(True)
