Question:

Consider the following:

A string,s , of length  where s= c0c1-... .
An integer,k , where  is a factor of n .
We can split  into  substrings where each subtring, , consists of a contiguous block of  characters in . Then, use each  to create string  such that:

The characters in  are a subsequence of the characters in .
Any repeat occurrence of a character is removed from the string such that each character in  occurs exactly once. In other words, if the character at some index  in  occurs at a previous index  in , then do not include the character in string .
Given  and , print  lines where each line  denotes string .

Example
s= string
k=integer

There are three substrings of length  to consider: 'AAA', 'BCA' and 'DDE'. The first substring is all 'A' characters, so . The second substring has all distinct characters, so . The third substring has  different characters, so . Note that a subsequence maintains the original order of characters encountered. The order of characters in each subsequence shown is important.

Function Description

Complete the merge_the_tools function in the editor below.

merge_the_tools has the following parameters:

string s: the string to analyze
int k: the size of substrings to analyze
Prints

Print each subsequence on a new line. There will be  of them. No return value is expected.

Input Format

The first line contains a single string,s .
The second line contains an integer, k, the length of each substring.

Constraints
Natural numbers 

It is guaranteed that n is a multiple of k .
Sample Input

STDIN       Function
-----       --------
AABCAAADA   s = 'AABCAAADA'
3           k = 3
Sample Output

AB
CA
AD


Solution:
def merge_the_tools(string, k):
    
    l= len(string)//k
    for i in range(l):
        print(''.join(dict.fromkeys(string[i*k:(i*k)+k])))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    string, k = input(), int(input())
    merge_the_tools(string, k)
